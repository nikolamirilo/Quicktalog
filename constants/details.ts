  {
    question: "What exactly is a digital catalog and how is it different from a website?",
    answer:
      "A digital catalog is a mobile-friendly, interactive showcase of your products or services that customers can browse, share, and access 24/7. Unlike a website, it's specifically designed for showcasing your offerings with easy updates, QR code sharing, and customer engagement features that drive sales.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need technical skills to create and manage my digital catalog?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! Our platform is designed for non-technical users. You can create your catalog using our simple interface, and if you have existing paper catalogs, our OCR technology can import them automatically. Most users create their first catalog in under 5 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time does it take to set up my first digital catalog?",
    answer:
      "Most users can create their first catalog in under 5 minutes. If you have existing materials, our OCR import feature can digitize them instantly. The simple interface makes it as easy as using a word processor, and you can go live immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I update my catalog easily when prices or services change?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! You can update your catalog anytime from your dashboard. Changes go live instantly, so your customers always see the most current information. No more waiting for designers or printing delays - update prices, add new services, and publish immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do my customers access my digital catalog?",
    answer:
      "You can share your catalog via a unique link or QR code. Customers can view it on any device - smartphones, tablets, or computers. No app downloads required for your customers, making it incredibly easy for them to access your services.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have a website? Do I still need a digital catalog?",
    answer:
      "Digital catalogs complement your website perfectly. While your website provides general information, a digital catalog is specifically designed for showcasing your products/services with easy sharing, QR codes, and customer engagement features that drive sales and improve customer experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see which items in my catalog are most popular?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Our analytics dashboard shows you views, popular items, customer engagement, and feedback. This helps you understand what your customers want and optimize your offerings to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure and private?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your data. Your catalog information is private and secure, and you have full control over what you share. Your business information is protected and accessible 24/7.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I need help or have questions?",
    answer:
      "We offer comprehensive support including tutorials, guides, and direct support. All plans include email support, with priority support available on higher tiers. We're here to help you succeed with your digital catalog.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this for my business catalog, service list, or product showcase?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Our platform is designed for any business that needs to showcase products or services. Whether you're a restaurant with a menu, a salon with services, a gym with classes, or any business with products to showcase - our platform works for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the free plan?",
    answer:
      "Our free plan includes one digital catalog with basic customization, QR code sharing, and email support. You can create, customize, and share your catalog with no time limits. No credit card required to start.",
  },
  {

      "We offer flexible pricing starting at $10/month for the Pro plan. Our Starter plan is free forever with one catalog. Higher tiers include more catalogs, AI features, OCR import, and advanced analytics to help you grow your business.",
